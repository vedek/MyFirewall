The big firewall in my basecode(TM)
TouchBase with me with this biolerplate code, you will have to go through my big FireWall. Please don't set the forest on fire.
Most of the code here is pure shit-in-shit-out, an improvement on the garbage-in-garbage-out policy.
Please fork responsibly, do not displace the trails.
